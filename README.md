# Maintenance AI Agent

A take-home assessment for building an AI-powered maintenance support agent. The goal is to create an intelligent assistant that can handle tenant maintenance requests — understanding issues, providing self-help guidance when appropriate, and coordinating professional help when needed.

This tests your ability to design and implement an AI agent that reasons about problems, retrieves relevant information, takes actions through tools, and handles real-world complexity.

## What This Is

A barebones starting point — a React chat interface and a simple Express API. There is no AI logic or pre-built architecture.

**You build everything.**

## What We're Looking For

| Area | What We're Evaluating |
|------|----------------------|
| **Information Retrieval** | How do you query and retrieve from knowledge sources (documents, policies, etc.)? |
| **Context & Memory** | How do you manage conversation context and maintain state across interactions? |
| **Agent Workflow** | How do you structure the agent's reasoning and decision-making process? |
| **Tool Use** | How does the agent use tools to take actions and gather information? |
| **Evaluation & Monitoring** | How do you measure and monitor the agent's performance? |
| **UI** | How do you show relevant information to the user about the agent or its outputs? |

## The Business Problem

You're building an AI agent for a property management company that handles tenant maintenance requests.

**Tenants message in with issues like:**
- "My smoke alarm won't stop beeping"
- "There's water coming through my ceiling"  
- "I've locked myself out"
- "The boiler pressure is too low"

### What the Agent Should Do

**1. Collect Information**
The agent should gather enough context from the tenant to understand the issue — what's happening, where, how urgent, etc.

**2. Try to Auto-Resolve**
Some issues have simple fixes that tenants can do themselves (e.g., resetting a tripped circuit breaker, repressurising a boiler). The agent should check the knowledge base and guide the tenant through self-resolution when possible.

**3. Escalate When Needed**
If the issue can't be self-resolved:
- **Contractor required**: Find an appropriate contractor, book a time slot, create a work order (as a PDF document shown in the chat), and debit the cost to the tenant's account
- **Needs human review**: Some issues require a property manager to get involved — escalate to the right person
